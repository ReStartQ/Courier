# Courier
Note: <br>
I have been working on a complete remake for this app (new code base). 
<br>
Courier v0.3.0 is the last version of the old app and will not receive any further updates. 
<br>
Please wait for the new app, which is expected to be released later this year (late 2023)

<br>
Courier is an Anime, Manga, and Light Novel Tracker Application for Windows. 
<br>
This desktop app helps you manage and track Anime, Manga, and Light Novels from [AniList](https://anilist.co/home), all in one app.  
A fast and engaging way to update your anime/manga/light novel lists with a couple of clicks.

## Downloads
You can download the app [here](https://github.com/ReStartQ/Courier/releases). Check for the latest version. 
<br>
1) Download whichever files you need from the release.  
2) If you want to install it on your computer, then get the setup exe file. (Recommended)
3) There is also a stand alone version of the app that is labeled as portable and does not require installation.
4) Use the app to track and manage your anime, manga, and light novels.

Check back for future releases
