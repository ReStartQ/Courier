## Download and Installation

You can download the app [here](https://github.com/ReStartQ/AniCour/releases). Check for the latest version.
<br /> **_Note: Some browsers may give a warning or block the download for the exe setup file as it does not have a code signing certificate._**
<br /> **_Whenever you get a warning message in the browser, you will have to allow for the download with an alternate option that may show up as something like "download suspicious file" (chrome) or "keep file" (edge)._**

1. Download the setup file from the latest release and install it on your computer.
2. The setup file is labeled as AniCour-Setup-x.x.x.exe, where x denotes a number for the version.
   <br/> **Ex: AniCour-Setup-1.4.9.exe**
3. When you run the exe file, Windows will give a message like below because there is no code signing certificate, click on "More info" <p align="center"><a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/ReStartQ/anicour/blob/main/images/help/AniCourNoCodeSigningInitial.png" /></a></p>
4. A new option will appear, "Run anyway". Click on it. <p align="center"><a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/ReStartQ/anicour/blob/main/images/help/AniCourNoCodeSigning.png" /></a></p>
