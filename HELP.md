1) The first time you launch Courier, a settings window should pop up. 
2) Enter your username and click the save button next to it. Be sure that you entered your username and not your email address. Your username is the same name that appears on your profile page.
3) The next step is to click the Go to AniList button to begin linking your account to Courier. 
4) Login to your account, allow for Courier to link your account, and copy/paste the token into the the token section of the settings page. Click the save button next to it.
5) If you logged into the wrong account, then you can always reset the login with the button next to it.
6) Finally, restart the application to apply your settings and begin your tracking journey.
