# Transfering anime/manga lists from myAnimeList to AniList

1) Transfering your lists from myAnimeList to AniList requires the export of your xml file from myAnimeList. <br>
   To export your xml file, use myAnimeList's [export service](http://myanimelist.net/panel.php?go=export).

2) The file format will be compressed, so you will need to extract it with an extracting tool such as winzip, winrar, etc.
3) To import it to AniList, use the import feature on the website's settings page.
